What is the revenue source for IndiaBookStore?
(a much asked question by our users)
We earn commission from online stores for each sale that happens through IndiaBookStore. The process is simple, you search for a book on IndiaBookStore, click on buy link, land to the online store's website, buy the book and we get commission on sales amount. All the sales through IndiaBookStore are tracked through a utm source code which resides in the URL of each sale done through IndiaBookStore. The commission amount is certain percentage of sales amount which is decided by the store.

In the cases when you compare book prices on IndiaBookStore and then open the online store website separately to make a purchase, IndiaBookStore doesn't get any commission.
